# HearthBites - Build Status Update

## ❌ Previous Build Failed (Why App Wasn't on Phone)

The app didn't install because the **build failed** with a Kotlin/Gradle compatibility error.

### What Was Wrong

```
Error: com/android/build/gradle/api/BaseVariant
Kotlin plugin compatibility issue with Gradle 8.3
```

## ✅ Fixed Issues

I've fixed these compatibility problems:

1. **Kotlin Plugin ID**
   - ❌ Old: `id "kotlin-android"` (deprecated)
   - ✅ New: `id "org.jetbrains.kotlin.android"` (correct for Gradle 8.x)

2. **Java Version Compatibility**
   - ❌ Old: Java 1.8 (too old for AGP 8.x)
   - ✅ New: Java 17 (compatible with Java 21 and AGP 8.x)

3. **Kotlin JVM Target**
   - ❌ Old: jvmTarget '1.8'
   - ✅ New: jvmTarget '17'

## 🚀 Currently Building

The app is **building RIGHT NOW** on your phone!

### Watch for Progress

In your terminal, you should see:
```
Running Gradle task 'assembleDebug'...
```

This will take 2-5 minutes on first build (downloads dependencies).

### Expected Output

```
✓ Built build/app/outputs/flutter-apk/app-debug.apk
Installing...
Waiting for CPH2219 to report its views...
Debug service listening on ws://127.0.0.1:xxxxx
Syncing files to device CPH2219...
```

Then the app will **automatically open** on your phone! 📱

## 📱 What to Expect

### On Your Phone

1. **Installation notification** - "Installing HearthBites"
2. **App icon appears** - Look for "HearthBites" in app drawer
3. **App automatically opens** - Shows the menu screen

### First Launch

The app will show:
- **Empty menu screen** (because no data created yet)
- **Cart icon** (top right)
- **Navigation** ready to work

## 🎯 Next Steps (After App Installs)

### 1. Create Sample Data (While Build Runs)

Open: **http://localhost:8001/docs**

**Create a Seller:**
```json
POST /api/v1/users/
{
  "role": "seller",
  "phone": "+923001234567",
  "name": "Fatima's Kitchen",
  "locale": "ur"
}
```

Copy the `id` from response, then:

**Create Menu Items:**
```json
POST /api/v1/menu?seller_id=<PASTE_SELLER_ID_HERE>
{
  "name": "Chicken Biryani",
  "photo_url": "https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1563379091339-03b21ab4a4f8",
  "category": "Main Course",
  "price_pk": 450,
  "portion": "1 plate (500g)",
  "is_available": true
}
```

Create 3-4 menu items like this!

### 2. Test the App

Once data is created:

1. **Hot Reload** the app (press 'r' in terminal)
2. **Menu items will appear** on the home screen
3. **Tap an item** to see details
4. **Add to cart**
5. **Checkout and place order**

## 📊 Build Timeline

| Time | Status |
|------|--------|
| 0-30s | Downloading Gradle dependencies |
| 30s-2m | Compiling Kotlin code |
| 2m-3m | Building APK |
| 3m-4m | Installing on phone |
| 4m+ | App opens! |

## 🔍 How to Check Build Progress

### In Terminal

The background build is running. To see progress:

```bash
# Check if flutter is running
ps aux | grep flutter

# Kill and restart in foreground (if you want to see logs)
pkill -f flutter
cd /home/l3k/HearthBites/app
flutter run -d 43a7e615
```

### Success Indicators

✅ **"Built build/app/outputs/flutter-apk/app-debug.apk"** → APK created!  
✅ **"Installing..."** → Transferring to phone  
✅ **"Debug service listening"** → App installed and running!  

## ⚠️ If Build Fails Again

If you see another error:

```bash
# Try with detailed logs
cd /home/l3k/HearthBites/app
flutter run -d 43a7e615 -v
```

Common issues:
- **Phone disconnected** → Reconnect USB
- **Developer mode disabled** → Re-enable USB debugging
- **Gradle timeout** → Re-run `flutter run`

## 🧪 Testing Checklist

Once app is installed:

**Backend:**
- [ ] Create seller user
- [ ] Create 3-4 menu items
- [ ] Verify items at http://localhost:8001/api/v1/menu

**Frontend:**
- [ ] App appears on phone
- [ ] Menu items display
- [ ] Can tap items
- [ ] Cart works
- [ ] Can place order

## 📱 Device Info

- **Device**: CPH2219 (OPPO)
- **OS**: Android 13 (API 33)
- **Connection**: USB (43a7e615)

## 🔧 Configuration Summary

```
Java: 21
Gradle: 8.7
Android Gradle Plugin: 8.3.0
Kotlin: 1.9.22
compileSdk: Auto (from Flutter)
minSdk: 21 (Android 5.0+)
targetSdk: Auto (from Flutter)
```

## 💡 Pro Tips

### Hot Reload (No Rebuild Needed!)

Once app is installed, you can make changes and:
- Press **'r'** in terminal → Hot reload (fast, keeps state)
- Press **'R'** in terminal → Hot restart (full restart)
- Press **'q'** → Quit

### Viewing Logs

```bash
# In the terminal where flutter run is active
# Logs will show automatically

# Or use adb:
adb logcat | grep flutter
```

### Backend + Frontend Together

Keep backend running in one terminal:
```bash
cd /home/l3k/HearthBites/server
source .venv/bin/activate
uvicorn app.main:app --reload --port 8001
```

Frontend in another:
```bash
cd /home/l3k/HearthBites/app
flutter run -d 43a7e615
```
