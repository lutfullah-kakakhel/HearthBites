# Push HearthBites to GitHub - Instructions

Your HearthBites project is now ready to be pushed to GitHub! 🚀

## ✅ What's Already Done

- ✅ Git repository initialized
- ✅ All 96 files committed to local git
- ✅ Branch renamed to `main`
- ✅ Proper `.gitignore` configured

## 📋 Step-by-Step Instructions

### Step 1: Create GitHub Repository

1. Go to https://github.com/new
2. **Repository name**: `HearthBites` (or any name you prefer)
3. **Description**: "Hyper-local home-food marketplace with rider delivery - Flutter + FastAPI"
4. **Visibility**: Choose Public or Private
5. **DO NOT** initialize with README, .gitignore, or license (we already have these)
6. Click **"Create repository"**

### Step 2: Push to GitHub

After creating the repository, GitHub will show you commands. Use these:

```bash
cd /home/l3k/HearthBites

# Add GitHub as remote origin
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/HearthBites.git

# Push to GitHub
git push -u origin main
```

**Replace `YOUR_USERNAME`** with your actual GitHub username!

### Step 3: Verify

After pushing, visit your GitHub repository URL:
```
https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/HearthBites
```

You should see:
- All 96 files
- README.md displayed on the homepage
- Complete folder structure (app/, server/, docs)

## 🔐 Using SSH (Recommended)

If you have SSH keys set up with GitHub:

```bash
cd /home/l3k/HearthBites

# Add remote using SSH
git remote add origin git@github.com:YOUR_USERNAME/HearthBites.git

# Push
git push -u origin main
```

## 🔑 Authentication Options

### Option 1: Personal Access Token (Recommended)

1. Go to GitHub → Settings → Developer settings → Personal access tokens → Tokens (classic)
2. Click "Generate new token (classic)"
3. Give it a name: "HearthBites"
4. Select scopes: `repo` (all)
5. Generate and copy the token
6. Use token as password when pushing:
   ```bash
   Username: your_github_username
   Password: paste_your_token_here
   ```

### Option 2: GitHub CLI

```bash
# Install GitHub CLI if not installed
# Then login and push
gh auth login
git push -u origin main
```

## 📁 What Will Be Backed Up

Your GitHub repo will contain:

```
HearthBites/
├── app/                    # Flutter mobile app
├── server/                 # FastAPI backend
├── README.md               # Project overview
├── SETUP_GUIDE.md          # Setup instructions
├── QUICKSTART.md           # Quick start guide
├── PROJECT_SUMMARY.md      # Feature summary
├── ARCHITECTURE.md         # Technical architecture
└── .gitignore             # Git ignore rules
```

**Total**: 96 files, 7,615 lines of code

## 🔄 Future Updates

After the initial push, to update your GitHub backup:

```bash
cd /home/l3k/HearthBites

# Add changes
git add .

# Commit
git commit -m "Description of changes"

# Push
git push
```

## ⚠️ Important Notes

### Files Already Excluded (via .gitignore)

These won't be pushed (which is correct):
- `/server/.env` - Contains secrets
- `/server/.venv/` - Python virtual environment
- `/server/__pycache__/` - Python cache
- `/app/build/` - Flutter build files
- `/app/.dart_tool/` - Dart tools
- Node modules and other temporary files

### Secrets Management

**Never commit these files:**
- `.env` files with real credentials
- API keys
- Database passwords
- JWT secrets

The `.gitignore` is already configured to exclude these!

## 🎯 Recommended Repository Settings

After pushing, configure these on GitHub:

1. **About** (top right on repo page):
   - Description: "Hyper-local home-food marketplace with rider delivery"
   - Website: (if you deploy it)
   - Topics: `flutter`, `fastapi`, `food-delivery`, `marketplace`, `mvp`

2. **Branch Protection** (Settings → Branches):
   - Protect `main` branch
   - Require pull request reviews (if working with team)

3. **Issues**:
   - Enable Issues for bug tracking
   - Create labels: `bug`, `enhancement`, `documentation`

4. **README Preview**:
   - Your beautiful README.md will be displayed automatically!

## 🚀 Advanced: Set Up CI/CD (Optional)

Create `.github/workflows/backend-tests.yml` for automated testing:

```yaml
name: Backend Tests

on: [push, pull_request]

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - uses: actions/setup-python@v4
        with:
          python-version: '3.11'
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: |
          cd server
          pip install -e .
          pip install -e ".[dev]"
      - name: Run tests
        run: |
          cd server
          pytest
```

## 📊 Repository Statistics

Once pushed, your repo will show:
- **Language**: Python (backend), Dart (frontend)
- **Files**: 96
- **Lines of code**: ~7,600
- **Commits**: 1 (initial)

## 🎉 Success Checklist

After pushing, verify:
- [ ] Can view repository on GitHub
- [ ] README.md displays properly
- [ ] All folders visible (app/, server/)
- [ ] Documentation files accessible
- [ ] .gitignore is working (no .env or build files)
- [ ] Can clone to another location and it works

## 🔄 Clone on Another Machine

To work on another computer:

```bash
# Clone
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/HearthBites.git
cd HearthBites

# Setup backend
cd server
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -e .
# Copy .env from secure location
alembic upgrade head

# Setup frontend
cd ../app
flutter pub get
flutter pub run build_runner build
```

## 💡 Pro Tips

1. **Commit Often**: Make small, focused commits
2. **Write Good Messages**: Describe what and why
3. **Use Branches**: For new features, create branches
4. **Pull Before Push**: If working with others, always pull first
5. **Tag Releases**: Use git tags for versions (`git tag v0.1.0`)

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

**Error: "remote origin already exists"**
```bash
git remote remove origin
git remote add origin YOUR_GITHUB_URL
```

**Error: "failed to push some refs"**
```bash
git pull origin main --rebase
git push -u origin main
```

**Authentication failed**
- Use Personal Access Token instead of password
- Or set up SSH keys

## 📞 Next Steps

After successful push:
1. Share the repo URL with collaborators
2. Set up branch protection rules
3. Enable GitHub Actions for CI/CD
4. Create issues for future enhancements
5. Add a LICENSE file if making it public
