# ✨ Cart/Checkout UI Improved!

## 🎉 What's New

I've made the checkout **MUCH MORE VISIBLE**! Here's what changed:

### 1. **Better Cart Icon Badge** 
✅ Fixed badge positioning - now uses Flutter's built-in `Badge` widget
✅ Badge no longer covers the cart icon
✅ Cleaner, more visible design

### 2. **Floating Action Button**
✅ When cart has items, you'll see a **floating "View Cart (X)" button**
✅ Always visible, easy to click
✅ Shows number of items in cart

### 3. **Bottom Cart Bar** (NEW! 🎊)
✅ **Orange bar at bottom** when cart has items
✅ Shows **total items count** and **total price**
✅ Tap anywhere on the bar to go to cart
✅ Shows arrow icon indicating it's clickable
✅ Super prominent and impossible to miss!

## 🔄 How to See the Changes

**In the terminal where Flutter is running, press:**

```
r
```

Just press the letter **'r'** and hit Enter - the app will hot reload with the new UI!

## 📱 What You'll See

### When Cart is Empty:
- ✅ Clean home screen
- ✅ Just the cart icon in app bar

### When Cart Has Items:
1. **App Bar**: Cart icon with small badge showing count
2. **Floating Button** (right side): "View Cart (3)" 
3. **Bottom Bar** (MAIN NEW FEATURE):
   ```
   [🛒 3 items] ────────────── [PKR 1450 →]
   ```
   - Orange/primary color background
   - White text
   - Shows cart summary
   - Tap to go to cart/checkout

FloatingActionButton.extended(
